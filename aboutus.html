                        <p>So Basically our idea is all about the creating the link between farmers,consumers and shopkeepers. By creating  a interface betwwen these three, it would be an easy work for farmers to sell their crops  and find an appropriate shop where he can sell his crops according to the cost that he estimated.All states in the country, except three, mandate that marketing and selling of farm produce must be routed through state-owned mandis, retail markets where middlemen squeeze farmers to increase margins.When a farmer registers on this website, it takes information of his produce, along with location details, and stores it on a scalable  database. For a buyer, it gives a clear view of available produce with the produce info, sorted by his economical proximity to the farmer. It’s as easy as a breeze to contact farmers, as his phone number will be available on the website.Our Project also Helps the shopkeepers to increase their marketing and sales by promoting their shops on our websites and helping them to increase their profits.So by providing the interface between farmers,customers ande shopkeepers it would lead to an well organised structure between consumer and retailers as they both are getting their suitable products.
                          
</p>
           <<p>The seemingly abundance of net sown area of 141.2 million hectares and total cropped area of 189.7 million hectares (1999-2000) pales into insignificance when we see that it is divided into economically unviable small and scattered holdings.  The proposed idea is definitely a good solution which could overcome many problems of current situation in India.
Indian farmers are second to none in production and productivity despite of the fact that millions are marginal and small farmers. They adopt improved agriculture technology as efficiently as farmers in developed countries. It is felt that with provision of timely and adequate inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and by making available affordable agricultural credit /crop insurance, Indian farmers are going to ensure food and nutritional security to the Nation. 
</p>   
                <p>The proposed solution can change the whole mechanism of farmers and shopkeepers trades as it reduces farmers effort of finding apropriate shops for selling their crops and the efforts of shopkeepers are saved.In fact it can be implemented anywhere where there can be perfect place for crops cultivation and setting up a shop .It has a lot of advantages which can result in  increase in the efficiency of the Farmer’s product and sale and implementing this process.
